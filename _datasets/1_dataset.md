title: "Effects of hunger on model-based and model-free decision-making"
description: "In this study, healthy participants were tested on the effects of hunger on model-free and model-based decision-making. Each first-stage choice rocket was predominantly associated with one of the second-stage planets (common transition: 70% of the trials) and sometimes with the other second-stage planet (rare transition: 30% of the trials). Each second-stage alien probabilistically lead to a reward. The reward probabilities for each second-stage alien fluctuated across trials between 25% and 75% according to a Gaussian random walk.
