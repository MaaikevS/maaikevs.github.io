title: "Effects of hunger on model-based and model-free decision-making"
description: "In this study, healthy participants were tested on the effects of hunger on risk preferences in two complementary tasks. In the experience-based task, participants learned the outcomes of options through sampling, whereas in the description-based task, the outcome probabilities and reward magnitudes were explicitly presented on the screen. The choices were further categorised into three different decision contexts: positive, negative or mixed decision context. Positive decision contexts concern choices between two options with equal expected value, but different level of risk, with outcomes above the average reward. Negative decision contexts concern choices between two options with equal expected value, but different level of risk, below the average reward. Mixed contexts concern choices between two options with different expected values.
