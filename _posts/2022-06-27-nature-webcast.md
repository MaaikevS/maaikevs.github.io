The sharing of research data is essential to ensure reproducibility and maximise the impact of scientific research. Data sharing also has many benefits for researchers, including contributing to career advancement, acquiring new funding, or meeting requirements of journals.


The EBRAINS Data and Knowledge services are based in the principle that, for the greatest impact, data should be shared in a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) manner, and offers support to neuroscientists in preparing data and metadata for sharing.


These services, co-funded by the European Commission and national funding bodies, are a collaborative effort of six research institutions across Europe that are coordinated by the EBRAINS Norwegian node at the University of Oslo.


This webcast will provide user examples of the data sharing process as well as tangible examples of how information stored in the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph can be extracted and leveraged to develop new research objectives and validate ongoing research.
