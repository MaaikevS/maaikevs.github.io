Together with fellow experts in the field, Mathew Birdsall Abrams and Stephanie Albin, I had the pleasure to share my perspectives on the road to effective data mining in the Special Interest Event “Making the most of precious data: challenges and opportunities in mining open data” at FENS 2022.

The aim of this session is to explore and identify the challenges and opportunities facing researchers who wish to better utilise or mine neuroscience and clinical data sets already available. Modern neuroscience and clinical methods generate huge amounts of data in a wide array of formats. Few laboratories, however, are effectively sharing or reusing data. This session will touch on how to create an environment conducive to data sharing and reuse. In addition, data must be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) to allow secondary analysis to generate new insights from existing data sets.
