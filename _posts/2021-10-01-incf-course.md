There is a general consensus among researchers, publishers and funding bodies that data sharing could tackle major reproducibility and transparency challenges that currently exist in the field of neuroscience. However, making your data open is not enough! To increase the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse potential of research, data needs to integrated properly. EBRAINS has developed standards and best practices to ensure that you will get the most out of data sharing; increased exposure of your research and credit in the form of citations.


In this course, we walk you through the curation process from start to finish and introduce you to workflows, integrated analysis pipelines and tools that can further research for yourself and others!
